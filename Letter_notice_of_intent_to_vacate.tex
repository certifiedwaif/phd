\opening{Dear Lewys Martin,}

I write to inform you of my intention to vacate the room I have been sub-letting from you. I give the standard
two week's notice period from today, and will cease to pay rent on the 12th of February, 2016. I will be
vacating the premises immediately, although I will need access to the property over the next two weeks to move
heavier items. You may advertise the premises for new tenants as soon as possible.

\closing{Yours,}

\end{letter}
