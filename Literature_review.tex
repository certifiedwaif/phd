\section{Chapter 1 -- Zero-Inflated Models}

Explaining Variational Approximations

Gaussian Variational Approximations

Approximate mean and covariance of mixed models using multivariate normal with mean $\vmu$ and covariance
matrix $\mSigma$, using convex optimsation algorithms to optimise the variational lower bound directly

B-Splines

Approximate functions with piecewise cubic polynomials

Zero-inflated and Bayesian models

\section{Chapter 3 -- Variational Bayes for Linear Model Selection Using Mixtures of g-Priors}

Zellner 1980

'Although Zellner and Siow 1980 did not explicitly use a $g$-prior formulation with a prior on $g$,
their recommendation of a multivariate Cauchy form for $p(\beta|\sigma^2)$ implicitly corresponds to using a
$g$-prior with an inverse Gamma prior'

Proposed Normal-Gamma conjugate model which includes $g$, with $g$ controlling the degree of shrinkage
from the fitted mean towards the prior mean.

Ormerod and Wand 2010

Explaining Variational Approximations

Highly cited paper explaining variational approximations using a number of examples.
Defines basic terms, and gives proofs of lower bound and optimal mean field update

George and Foster 2000

Proposed selecting the model maximising the posterior probability of model $\gamma$ based on empirical
Bayes estimates of $g$ and the standard unbiased estimate of $\sigma^2$

Cui and George 2008

Proposed marginning out $g$ with respect to a prior

Liang 2008

Builds on Zellner 1980, by proving that any fixed choice of $g$ leads to various kinds of paradoxes e.g.
Information Paradox, Bartlett's Paradox.
Proposed marginning out $g$ and $\sigma^2$ with respect to priors.

Murayama and George 2011

Fully Bayes Factors with a Generalised $g$-Prior
Normal linear model, model selection based on a fully Bayes formulation with a generalisation of Zellner's
$g$-prior which allows for $p > n$
