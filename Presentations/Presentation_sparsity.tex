\frametitle{tldr version - you (probably) don't have to do anything}
\begin{itemize}
\item Key phrase: \emph{"You don't need to be using a sparse matrix representation to be 
												 benefitting from the sparsity in your matrices"}
\item Reference BLAS checks for zeros and takes appropriate shortcuts when doing linear 
			algebra
\item If your matrices contain many zeros, you're probably already benefitting from this
\item You don't have to do anything differently. You don't even have to know
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Slightly longer version - dense versus sparse matrix representations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sparsity of a matrix refers to the proportion of non-zero elements it contains
\item A dense matrix representation stores all matrix elements, zero or non-zero
\item A sparse matrix representation stores only the non-zero elements
\item This can lead to great benefits in speed and memory use if your matrices are large, 
			say, 1000 by 1000
\item Probably no benefit if your matrices are smaller than this. If your matrices are
			small it can make the performance much worse
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{The Matrix library in R}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Matrix library by Douglas Bates of lme4 fame and Martin Maechler is very mature 
			and has	a great implementation of both dense and sparse matrices if you'd like to try
\item It was from getting puzzling performance and reading the Matrix library documentation 
			that I came across this:
			``Note that in newer versions of R and the BLAS library (as of summer 2007),
				the R \%*\% is able to detect the many zeros in mm and shortcut many operations''
