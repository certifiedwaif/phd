Dear Professor Dianne Cook,

We wish to submit a new manuscript entitled ``Numerical aspects of Bayesian linear models averaging using
mixture g-priors'' for consideration by the Journal of Graphical and Computational Statistics.

We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor is it currently under
consideration for publication elsewhere.

In this article, we report on Bayesian linear model averaging using new analytic expressions for the
posterior model probablity when using g priors. This is significant because of the substantial computational
advantages to our approach. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of Bayesian model selection
and Bayesian model averaging.

We derive new closed form expressions for the model probability posteriors in terms of special functions.
We show that the expressions we have derived are numerically stable when evaluated. We demonstrate that when 
combined with a scheme for averaging over the models efficiently using rank-one updates and downdates,
our approach has significant computational advantages, outperforming other Bayesian model averaging software
in the literature on several standard example data sets. We develop an R package implementing these ideas,
which is available on GitHub.

Please address all correspondence concerning this manuscript to me at markg@maths.usyd.edu.au.

Thank you for consideration of this manuscript.

Sincerely,

Mark Greenaway
