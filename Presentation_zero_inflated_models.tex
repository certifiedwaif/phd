Introduction
Zero inflated data, where it arises
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Univariate
Model formulation
Mean field updates
Results/Accuracy - excellent accuracy
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Multivariate
Extension from univariate, model formulation
Mixed models -- one mode to rule them all
The need for better approaches - MCMC with existing software can take minutes to
converge, if they converge at all. That might not sound so bad to you, but how do you
do model selection?
Lack of conjugacy means mean field updates won't be analytically tractable. Try
Gaussian Variational Approximations instead
Computation - a work in progress
