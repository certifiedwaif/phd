\begin{frame}{Writing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item My first paper is taking shape
		\item My introduction is still too short, so I'll be working on that
		\item Writing in LaTeX with Sublime Text - let's me focus on the text
		\item Reference managers like Mendeley speed things up
		\item Rediscovering my inner pedant
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why did it take so long?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rusty - I'd been away from mathematical statistics for four years and had a lot of things to
					relearn
		\item A lot of new things to learn - I was new to variational approximations
		\item Numerical issues, primarily overflows
		\item Speed rabbit hole
		\item Programming takes forever
		\item Testing. So much testing.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What worked?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item git
		\item C++
		\item Command line programs/repeatibiliity
		\item Reading books on numerical analysis/numerical linear algebra to figure out what was going on
		\item Using a programmer's text editor for my R coding - I need to be able to see all the code. I like
					Sublime Text, but I'd also recommend Vim and Emacs
		\item Trello
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What didn't?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I've developed a love/hate relationship with R. Great for interactive data analysis, or
					prototyping an idea
		\item Not listening to my supervisor enough. But that never works
		\item Putting off learning things. You'll just have to learn them later anyway
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Package - seperate fitting code and testing code
		\item Model selection
		\item Skew normals
		\item Logistic regression
		\item More C++
		\item GPUs
		\item Quite a lot of reading and writing
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
