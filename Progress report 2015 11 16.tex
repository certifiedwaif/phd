\begin{frame}{Numerical experiments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The numerical experiments for the paper are mostly done
		\item I don't believe it either
		\item Still more to do in the future for my thesis, but that's a problem for future Mark to contend with
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Writing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item My first paper is taking shape
		\item My introduction is still too short, so I'll be working on that
		\item Writing in LaTeX with Sublime Text - let's me focus on the text
		\item Reference managers like Mendeley speed things up
		\item Rediscovering my inner pedant
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why did it take so long?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rusty - I'd been away from mathematical statistics for four years and had a lot of things to
					re-learn
		\item A lot of new things to learn as well - I was new to variational approximations
		\item Numerical issues, primarily overflows
		\item Speed rabbit hole - I now know a lot about R performance. But I'm not sure whether it was really
					worth it
		\item Programming takes forever
		\item Testing. So much testing
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What worked well?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Trello/Getting Things Done
		\item git/GitHub
		\item I've developed a love/hate relationship with R. Great for prototyping a numerical idea
		\item C++ for speeding up critical sections of code
		\item Command line programs/repeatibiliity
		\item Reading books on numerical analysis/numerical linear algebra to figure out what was going on
		\item Using a programmer's text editor for my R coding - I need to be able to see all the code. I like
					Sublime Text, but I'd also recommend Vim and Emacs. It's all about what works for you
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What didn't work well?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As I said, I've developed a love/hate relationship with R. Great for interactive data analysis, or
					prototyping an idea. Frankly, not great for other things
		\item Optimising the performance of R code is quite difficult, even for experienced R 
					programmers who understand the underlying implementation quite well
		\item I didn't listen to my supervisor enough. But that never works well
		\item Putting off learning things. You'll just have to learn them later anyway
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Package the code - seperate fitting code and testing code
		\item Model selection
		\item Skew normals
		\item Logistic regression
		\item More C++
		\item GPUs
		\item Quite a lot of reading and writing
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
