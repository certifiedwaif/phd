Laplacian approximations
Most important facts about Multivariate Gaussians that keep coming up
Cov(X) = E(X - E X)(X - E X)^T = E(X X^T) - (E X)^2
Therefore, E(X X^T) = Cov(X) + (E X)^2

\section{Notes from 8/5/2013 meeting}
I met up with John to see why my mixed model code wasn't fitting correctly.
It turned out that there were several problems. I should have been generating
test data with more groups. Also, I misunderstood Laplace approximations -
you're just maximising the log likelihood, not the Gaussian approximation to
the log likelihood.

The code now seems to work quite well for the one test case that we tried,
but less well when you change any of the settings.
