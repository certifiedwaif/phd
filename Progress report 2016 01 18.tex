\begin{frame}{Third year}
John used to think I was incompetent. Now he just thinks I'm lazy. That's \emph{progress}!
\begin{itemize}
\item Six months to do the work for the second paper
\item Begin third paper
\item Write thesis
\item OMG
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Work at the right level}

With time running out, I have to alter my strategy. I don't have the luxury of
playing around with different ways of calculating things anymore. Computers
are a means to an end.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Statisticians / applied mathematicians
\item Numerical analysts
\item Computer scientists
\end{enumerate}

It's fine for everyone to work at level one, and for people like John or
myself to work at level two. But we shouldn't spend too much time at level
three. We should let computer scientists do their jobs, and we should do ours.

\begin{frame}{Correlation}
Rank one updates
$O(p^3)$ to $O(p^2)$
I have C++ that can fit 50,000 models per second on a single core, doing $O(p^3)$ inversions. I should
be able to improve substantially on this by using rank one updates and basic parallelisation 
techniques.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{R and C++}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm getting much better at writing C++.
\item People typically design their algorithms to minimise the number of floating point operations. 
	  They should also pay attention to how memory is used.
\item Good numerical linear algebra textbooks
	  e.g. Numerical Linear Algebra by Trefethen and Bau make this point early and forcefully.
\item I'm using the Eigen library for linear algebra. I'm in good company. Douglas Bates (lme4) and
      Dirk Eddelbuettel (Rcpp) recommend this approach in ``Fast and Elegant Numerical Linear Algebra Using the RcppEigen Package''.
\item CPUs single core first, then multi core, then GPUs.
\item OpenMP/RcppParallel for parallelisation.
\item Everything will be released in an R package that runs on all platforms and that everyone can 		  use.
\end{itemize}
