\begin{frame}{Optimising numerical software, a re-match \ldots}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item My Eigen-based \texttt{correlations.cpp} code was within 20\% of the performance of the old
			\texttt{ZE.cpp} code.
\item I \emph{knew} I could do better than that.
\item Got sent the paper ``Exploiting Vector Instructions with Generalized Stream Fusion'' by Geoffrey 
			Mainland, Roman Leshchinskly and Simon Peyton Jones. It mentions Eigen and \emph{expression templates} -
			the missing link!
\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|rr|}
\hline
Change & Time (s) & Speed-up \\
& (1 core) & \\
\hline
Unoptimised code, correct results & 33.0 & 1.00\\
Save common sub-expressions in rank-1 update & 18.0 & 1.83 \\
Use references to avoid copying & 16.0 & 2.06 \\
Pre-allocate memory for $\mX_\vgamma$ and $(\mX_\vgamma^\top \mX_\vgamma)^{-1}$ & 9.0 & 3.66 \\
Pre-calculate $\mX^\top \mX$ & 6.6 & 5.00 \\
Use templates (tl;dr less ``copying''/evaluating) & 1.9 & 17.37 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\item The previous version of the software could solve the Hitters problem in
$0.472$ s for $p=13$ and $n=263$ on verona using all 48 cores. 
\item Now I can do that in $0.460$ s on my desktop machine with 8.
\item Over a million models a second on your home machine. Or John's laptop.
\item That's \emph{it}. This software is finished!
% \item Other tricks I could try, but for now, that's fast enough!
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{topserver, and servers \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item The software is now properly packaged. Good practice for packaging the correlations code.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
devtools::install\_github("certifiedwaif/topserver")
\end{verbatim}
\item \texttt{get\_topserver()} now returns a data frame, so it's easy to see which servers are loaded and 
			which servers are free. That turned out to be handy, because \ldots
\item Our old friend Andrew Stefan is back! On Friday night he was hitting every server in the school with
			32 cores or more.
\item I calmly explained to him that my software, which took 1,900 ms to run on my home machine on one core 
			was now taking ~6,700 ms to run on one core on verona, due to caching effects.
\item He graciously backed off from using 40 cores on verona to only using 20.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Graycode}
\begin{itemize}
\item John asked me to generalise the correlation software so that some variables could remain fixed
			while others were allowed to vary.
\item Only the graycode needed to change. Everything else stayed exactly the same.
\item The resulting graycode looks like this:

\begin{frame}{Theoretical problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time to take a break from computers for a few weeks.
\item Let $R^2_{\mX, \mZ} = \frac{
\begin{pmatrix}
\vy^\top \mX & \vy^\top \mZ
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\mX^\top \mX & \mX^\top \mZ \\
\mZ^\top \mX & \mZ^\top \mZ + \mZ^\top \mZ \odot (\mI - \mW^{-1})
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\vy^\top \mX\\
\vy^\top \mZ
\end{pmatrix}
}{\vy^\top \vy}$
\item We wish to show that $R^2_{\mX, \mZ} = R^2_\mX + O(w^*)$
\end{itemize}
