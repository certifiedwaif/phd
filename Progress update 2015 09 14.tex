\begin{frame}{What I've been up to this week}
\begin{itemize}
\item Working on first paper. Calculating confidence intervals for splines.
\item Reading about BFGS in Classical and Modern Numerical Analysis.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Calculating confidence intervals for splines}
\begin{itemize}
\item We're trying to examine the difference between the VB and MCMC fits.
We expect the MCMC fit to have more variance.
\item Confidence intervals are calculated by grid search, calculating the
appropriate $\mC_x$ for each value of $x$ with an appropriate set of knots.
\item We then sample from the appropriate fitted distribution from VB and MCMC 
1,000 times and take upper and lower quintiles.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Distribution that I was sampling from}
\begin{itemize}
\item I was generating samples $\vnu \sim N(\vmu, \mLambda)$ and then 
calculating $\hat{f} = \mC_x \vnu$.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Distributions I should have been sampling from}
\begin{itemize}
\item I should have been generating samples from $\hat{f} \sim N(\mC_x \vmu, \mC_x \mLambda \mC_x^\top)$.

\item That's better, but the confidence intervals are still the same size.
I'm not sure why this is yet. The MCMC might not be sampling effectively.
\end{itemize}
