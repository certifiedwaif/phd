\begin{frame}{Recap}
We consider a linear model with a g-prior, as in Liang 2008. Consider the linear model
\begin{align*}
\vy | \vbeta, \sigma^2 \sim \N_n(\mX \vbeta, \sigma^2 \mI)
\end{align*}

with priors
\begin{align*}
\vbeta | \sigma^2, g &\sim \N_p(\vzero, g \sigma^2 (\mX^T \mX)^{-1}) \\
p(\sigma^2) &= (\sigma^2)^{-1} \I(\sigma^2 > 0) \\
p(g) &= \frac{g^b (1 + g)^{-(a + b + 2)}}{\Beta(a + 1, b + 1)} \I(g > 0)
\end{align*}

\begin{frame}{How to think about g}

\begin{itemize}
\item It's a penalty on dimension of your model.

\item This is most easily seen in the Bayes factor between the model $\gamma$ and the null model:
\begin{equation*}
\text{BF}[M_\gamma:M_N] = (1 + g)^{(n - p_\gamma - 1)/2} [1 + g(1 - R_\gamma^2)]^{-(n-1)/2}
\end{equation*}

\item Terms involving one plus a multiple of $g$ appear in both the numerator and the denominator, but the
exponent in the numerator will be lower when the dimension of $\gamma$ is higher.
\item Higher $R^2_\gamma$ i.e. better model fit compensates for this in the numerator to an extent.
\item So we're trading off between model fit and model complexity
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Short version: it worked! 4 days' work -- straightforward translation
\item Accuracy numbers match John's

\begin{frame}{Next steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item John asked me to add some features
\item I haven't really optimised the $\tau_g$ software yet
\item John and I would both like to know how much further we can push this
\item We can exhaustively search 19 or 20 variables comfortably. Can do we 30, or 40?
\item The next obvious thing to try is GPU acceleration
\item gcc supports OpenACC acceleration on NVidia GPUs. Similiar to the OpenMP extensions
that I'm already using
\item I've never done it before. But last year, I hadn't done any multicore. How hard can it be? ;-)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Writing/Reading}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm working on the introduction to my paper
\item I've been reading Liang, Jordan's STAT260 notes and Teh to get a sense of what's important and the
structure that's expected
\item I had a chat with Lamiae about Bayesian nonparametrics. That sounded really cool, so I've been reading
about that
\item Draft of my abstract for ASC 2016 is done, will submit in the next day or two
\end{itemize}
