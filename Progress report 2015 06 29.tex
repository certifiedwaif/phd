\begin{frame}{Progress this week - still getting numerical results and fixing bugs}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm gathering median accuracy results by generating 100 random data sets and then fitting
			models to them
\item Testing median accuracy was taking up for forty minutes for each run on a 32 core machine,
			so I split the MCMC and variational approximation into seperate tasks and saved the MCMC 
			output on verona to re-use each time. ~12 gigabytes of data.
\item After feedback from last week, I've added titles and accuracy figures to the distribution
			plots and labelled the axes on the median accuracy graphs
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Bugs I've found, and bugs yet to find}
\begin{itemize}
\item After generating median accuracy figures last week, I investigated some of the cases where 				the accuracy of the approximation was poor
\item Bugs in data generation for the random intercepts case, now fixed
\item I was trying to solve a problem which was too hard. I was fitting a random intercepts
			model to 20 groups with 10 observations in each, with half zeroes.
			I've decreased the zeroes from $\frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$
\item Early convergence of the optimiser in some cases. I've increased the maximum iterations
			of L-BFGS-B from 100 to 1,000
\item There are cases where the accuracy is still poor. From initial investigation, this appears to
			be a property of the data, or bugs in the implementation, rather than a property of the
			approximation itself. I'm tracking down and fixing these bugs as quickly as I can
\end{itemize}
