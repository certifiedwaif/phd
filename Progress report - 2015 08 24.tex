\begin{frame}{Dimension reduction on covariance matrices}
\begin{itemize}
\item It worked! Took around two hours to implement.
\item Optimising over the sparse covariance matrices is three times faster than optimising
		over the dense covariance matrices.
\item Would probably be even better if I could exploit sparse matrices fully.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Application}
\begin{itemize}
\item I found an alternative data set on cockroaches.
\item Cockroach traps are laid in apartments and observed at two timepoints.
\item Number of cockroaches trapped, number of trap misses and number of days the trap was laid
	  before cockroaches were collected are recorded at each of the two timepoints.
\item Some apartments were not followed up.
\item Pest treatment, senior, building number and the number of stories of the building are also
      recorded.
\item Many apartments are observed within the same building, leading to a hierarchical model.
\item Random intercept for each building.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Next project: Bayesian model selection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The literature looks interesting
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
