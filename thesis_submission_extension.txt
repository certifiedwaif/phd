Dear Marek,

In my progress review, we discussed my desire to extend my thesis
submission deadline to December 2017. Do you know which form I need to
fill in? I've discussed this with my supervisor.

My current plan for each month is:
June: Write code for Collapsed Variational Approximation, debug
numerical issues.
July: Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical experiments
with different priors. Analyse
epilepsy data with the Zero-Inflated Poisson model.
August: Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical
experiments with different priors, write up
numerical results of these experiments.
September: Write and edit thesis, any final additional numerical
experiments.
October: Write and edit thesis.
November: Write and edit thesis.
December: Write and edit thesis. Submit thesis.

So far, things are going according to plan.


Thanks,

Mark
