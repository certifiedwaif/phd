Dear Marek,

I request an extension on my thesis submission until December 2017.

My plan for each month is:
June: Write code for Collapsed Variational Approximation, debug numerical issues.
July: Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical experiments with different priors. Analyse 
epilepsy data with the Zero-Inflated Poisson model.
August: Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical experiments with different priors, write up 
numerical results of these experiments.
September: Write and edit thesis, any final additional numerical experiments.
October: Write and edit thesis.
November: Write and edit thesis.
December: Write and edit thesis. Submit thesis.

Mark
