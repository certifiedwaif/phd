\subsection{QTL example}
The QTL example is taken from \cite{Xu2007}. A BC population of $n=600$ was simulated for a single large
chromosome of $1800$ cM. This chromosome was covered by 121 evenly spaced markers. Nine of the markers
overlapped with QTL of the main effects and $13$ out of the $121 \choose{2} = 7,260$ possible marker pairs had
interaction effects.

The high dimemsional Particle EM example is taken from \cite{Rockova2016}.
We assume $p = 200$, $n = 100$ and $\mSigma = \text{bdiag}(\mSigma_1, \ldots, \mSigma_1)$ with
$\mSigma_1 = \sigma_{ij}$, $i, j = 1, \ldots, 10$ and $\sigma_{ij} = 0.99$, $i \ne j$ and $\sigma_ii = 1$.

\begin{frame}
Three methods of initialising $\Gamma$ were used.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cold start each $\gamma_{ij}$ in $\gamma_i$, $1 \leq i \leq K$ were initialised randomly from a
$\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ distribution, with $p = 10 / K$
\item Two methods of warm start were also tried, to explore whether the CVA algorithm could do better by being
initialised from another method than by being initialised randomly. 
\item Warm start from SCAD, preferring models with higher marginal likelihood
\item Warm start from SCAD, preferring models with more covariates
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
