Three methods of initialising $\Gamma$ were used.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cold start each $\gamma_{ij}$ in $\gamma_i$, $1 \leq i \leq K$ were initialised randomly from a
$\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ distribution, with $p = 10 / K$
\item Two methods of warm start were also tried, to explore whether the CVA algorithm could do better by being
initialised from another method than by being initialised randomly. 
\item Warm start from SCAD, preferring models with higher marginal likelihood
\item Warm start from SCAD, preferring models with more covariates
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A warm start from scad preferring models with more covariates included did very well}
