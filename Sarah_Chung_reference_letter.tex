Dear City University,

I am Mark Greenaway, a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. I tutor first, second and third year
subjects in statistics at the University of Sydney, in the School of Mathematics and Statistics.

I have tutored Sarah Chung for three semesters of her three year undergraduate degree in mathematics and
statistics at the University of Sydney. I have found her to be an exceptionally capable, hard-working and most
of all motivated student who always sought a deeper understanding the the material. She has always
distinguished herself from the other students with her enthusiasm and willingness to work harder than others
to learn the finer points of statistics. She particularly excelled in STAT3012 Applied Linear Regression and
STAT3014 Applied Statistics, placing her in the top ten percent of the class. Sarah is also a clear
communicator, and motivates those around her.

I have no hesitation in recommending Sarah as a student for the MSc in Financial Math or the MSC Actuarial
Science. I'm sure she will continue to distinguish herself, as she has at the University of Sydney.

Yours, \\
Mark Greenaway \\
PhD candidate, University of Sydney
