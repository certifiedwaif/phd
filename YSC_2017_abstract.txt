The problem of variable selection in the context of linear models is well-studied.  Maruyama & George (2011)
introduced the hyperparameter $g$ to control Bayesian model averaging. The prior on  $g$ must be carefully
chosen to ensure model selection consistency and avoid paradoxes such as Bartlett's  Paradox and the
Information Paradox. Liang et al. (2008) showed that while a fixed choice of $g$ falls prey to these
paradoxes, a mixture of $g$ avoids them.

We consider linear models with a special case of the prior structure proposed in Maruyama & George (2011) and
perform numerical analyses of the resulting parameter posterior distributions. To this end we derive several
approaches including Monte Carlo sampling schemes.
We derive new exact expressions for these posterior parameter distributions in terms of special functions and
distributions where possible, and provide convenient asymptotic approximations of parameter posterior distributions where exact expressions could not be obtained. Implementation
issues of Bayesian model averaging under the proposed prior structure are also discussed and R software is made
availables for this purpose. Our methodology is illustrated on several datasets.
