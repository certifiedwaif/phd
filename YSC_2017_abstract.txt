The problem of variable selection in the context of linear models is well-studied.  Zellner (1986) introduced
the prior hyperparameter $g$ to control Bayesian model averaging.
An alternative choice of hyperprior with computational advantages was proposed by Maruyama & George (2011).
Weighted by eigenvalues, rotated parameter space.

The hyperprior on $g$ must be carefully
chosen to ensure model selection consistency and avoid paradoxes such as Bartlett's  Paradox and the
Information Paradox. Liang et al. (2008) showed that while a fixed choice of $g$ falls prey to these
paradoxes, a mixture of $g$-priors avoids them.

We consider linear models with a special case of the prior structure proposed in Maruyama & George (2011) and
perform numerical analyses of the resulting parameter posterior distributions. To this end we derive several
approaches including Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We derive new exact expressions for these posterior
parameter distributions in terms of special functions and distributions where possible, and derive exact
expression for the first and second posterior moments for the other parameters. We provide convenient
asymptotic approximations of parameter posterior distributions where exact expressions could not be obtained.
We show that, under a particular asymptotic setting, model averaging using the chosen prior is asymptotically
equivalent to model averaging under the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Implementation issues of Bayesian model averaging under the proposed prior structure are also discussed and R
software is made availables for this purpose. Our methodology is illustrated on several datasets from the
StatLib library.
