% Details from last time: Gaussian variational approximation

% Detail what progress has been made, and what results have been obtained
% Algorithms:
% i) Optimise with L-BFGS, mLambda = R R^T
% ii) Optimise with L-BFGS, mLambda = (R R^T)^-1
% iii) Newton-Raphson optimisation on the variational lower bound
% iv) Newton-Raphson optimisation on the variational lower bound, using block inverses

% Motivations behind the algorithms
% ii) The Cholesky factor of a block matrix of the form
% diag for random effects, block for cross effects
% block for cross effects, diag for fixed effects
% is mostly diagonal
% Less parameters to optimise and store

% Work to date
% 2000 lines of R code
% 93 functions
% Debugging. So much debugging ...

% Accuracy results
% Accuracy verified using 1 million MCMC iterations from Stan
% Stan converts your model specification into C++ code
% A one million iteration run ``only'' takes ten CPU hours per chain
% Can be parallelised across multiple cores
% The need for approximate methods is obvious

% Further work
% All algorithms should arrive at exactly the same result, up to numerical error ~10^-8
% Algorithms i and iii work well
% Algorithm ii does not get exactly the right result
% Algorithm ii works on some data sets, but this isn't good enough
% That is, I have concerns about its stability
% Algorithm iv is yet to be implemented
% Splines should be ``easy'' to implement, but I've heard that before
% Shut up and write
