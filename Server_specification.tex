\section{Specifications for server}
Budget: $15k-$25k
Main use cases
The server will be used principally by the statistics research group, and in particular the bioinformatics researchers. The main
computationally demanding tasks that they perform are
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Mapping} This uses large quantities of RAM, gigabytes of it. We should not
consider getting a server configured with any less than 128 gigabytes of RAM.
\item{Processing large data sets} The researchers regularly process data in the
terabyte range. To process these volumes of data quickly we will use a solution like
RAID striping across multiple hard disks. To ensure that these disks performance well
in this configuration, we need a controller that will support this many hard disks at
full speed, in this configuration. We could use software RAID, or possibly consider a
solution involving hardware RAID at the controller level.
\end{enumerate}
