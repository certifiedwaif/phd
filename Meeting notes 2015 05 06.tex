\section{B-Spline basics}

Recall that a smooth function
\[
	S_{n, t}(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i B_{i, n} (x)
\]

can be constructed as a linear combination of the B-Spline functions, which are recursively
defined as
\begin{align*}
	B_{i, 1} (x) &:= 
	\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if } t_i \leq x < t_{i + 1} \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases} \\
	B_{i, k} (x) &:= \frac{x - t_i}{t_{i + k - 1} - t_i} B_{i, k - 1}(x) +
									\frac{t_{i + k} - x}{t_{i + k} - t_{i + 1}} B_{i + 1, k - 1} (x)
\end{align*}.

These functions have local support, and can be evaluated using de Boor's algorithm,
which is numerically stable. Moreover, their derivatives can be evaluated at any point.

\section{Meeting}

I went to see John, who was trying to modify the existing code for calculating Omega
to exclude anything that was linearly dependent with $[1 x]$. The code is very clever,
and perfect for the previous case which it was being used, but because of its vectorised
structure it was very hard to modify.

We approximate the penalty integral by Simpson's Rule.
\[
	(x_2 - x_1) \left [\frac{f(x_1) + 4 f(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) + f(x_2)}{6} \right ]
\]

\begin{align*}
	\mX &= [1, x] \\
	\mZ &= \tilde \mB \\
	\vbeta &\sim N(\vzero, \sigma_\vbeta^2 \mI) \\
	\vu &\sim N(\vzero, \sigma_\vu^2 \mOmega) \\
	&\int f''(x)^2 dx \\
	&\int \vv^T C''(x) C''(x)^T \vv dx
\end{align*}

I was ignorant of the fact that $\mOmega$ was used in the prior.
