\textbf{Progress Plan}

\bigskip\noindent
I request to extend my thesis submission deadline to December 2017. I have discussed this with my
primary supervisor, and the postgraduate coordinator.

My current plan for each month is:
\begin{itemize}
\item[June] Write code for Collapsed Variational Approximation, debug
numerical issues.
\item[July] Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical experiments
with different priors. Analyse
epilepsy data with the Zero-Inflated Poisson model.
\item[August] Perform Collapsed Variational Approximation numerical
experiments with different priors, write up
numerical results of these experiments.
\item[September] Write and edit thesis, any final additional numerical
experiments.
\item[October] Write and edit thesis.
\item[November] Write and edit thesis.
\item[December] Write and edit thesis. Submit thesis.
\end{itemize}

My research is progressing on schedule.
