\begin{itemize}
\def \O { \text{O} }
\item Theorem: $R^2_{\mX, \mZ} = R^2_\mX + \O(w_*)$
\item I believe that this theorem has been successfully proved. John has yet to tell me any different.
\item The proof is largely original work. John set the problem, but I solved it in my own way. So that's a
			major milestone passed - the first truly original thing I've ever done in mathematics.
\item We've decided on the final model for the fully Bayesian model, and the VB and Collapsed VB
			approximations.
\item Numeric problems solved for the cases that we care about.
\item Deriving mean field update equations as fast as possible.
\item I hope to begin coding so that I can start performing numerical experiments within the next few
			weeks. It is April, after all \ldots
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{IT Committee Meeting}
\begin{itemize}
\item The new computer budget for new PhD students has been increased to $\$2,700$.
\item You could buy a nice laptop for that. Or a great desktop machine. Paul will support any desktop
			machine from Dell.
\item Sarah, Chang and Kevin - you are all eligible. Get on it!!!
\item The issue of how often we should upgrade R was raised. Should we upgrade every year? Every six months?
			Every time that there's a new release?
\item Should we run the same version of R on the undergrad and research servers?
\item We need to discuss this as a group. What do you need?
\item Fonts were not discussed, unfortunately.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}{The Shiny server -- the bad news}
% \small
% \begin{itemize}
% \item In the meeting, Paul agreed to administrate the R Shiny Server if Jean buys the machine.
% \item I argued that it was not the job of PhD students or academic staff to administrate machines, but the job 
% 			of our systems administrators. We already have more than enough work to do.
% \item We don't have root/sudo access on School machines, and we don't want it either.
% \item Over the weekend, Paul completely back-flipped on this. He's now claiming that he never agreed to any
% 			such thing.
% \item I recall the discussion we had on this issue distinctly. The meeting minutes prove that he did agree.
% \item He now claims the department ``doesn't have the manpower''. I've successfully countered both claims. 
% 			Setting up a server	like this would take a competent systems admiinstrator a day, max. We've spent more 
% 			time discussing this than it would have taken!
% \item Over to you! I have research to do. I'm strongly considering stepping down from the committee.
