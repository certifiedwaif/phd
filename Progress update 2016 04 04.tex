\begin{itemize}
\def \O { \text{O} }
\item Theorem: $R^2_{\mX, \mZ} = R^2_\mX + \O(w_*)$
\item I believe that this theorem has been successfully proved. John has yet to tell me any different.
\item The proof is largely original work. John set the problem, but I solved it in my own way. So that's a
			major milestone passed - the first truly original thing I've ever done in mathematics.
\item We've decided on the final model for the fully Bayesian model, and the VB and Collapsed VB
			approximations.
\item Numeric problems solved for the cases that we care about.
\item Deriving mean field update equations as fast as possible.
\item I hope to begin coding so that I can start performing numerical experiments within the next few
			weeks. It is April, after all \ldots
\end{itemize}

\small
\begin{itemize}
\item[Budget] \begin{itemize}
\item The new computer budget for new PhD students has been increased to $\$2,700$.
\item Paul will support any desktop	machine from Dell.
\item Sarah, Chang and Kevin - you are all eligible. Get on it!!!
\end{itemize}
\item[Upgrades]
\begin{itemize}
\item The issue of how often we should upgrade R was raised. How often should we upgrade?
\end{itemize}
\item[Shiny] \begin{itemize}
\item Paul agreed to administrate the R Shiny Server if Jean buys the machine.
\item I argued that it was not the job of PhD students or academic staff to administrate machines, but the job 
			of our systems administrators. We already have more than enough work to do.
\item For some reason he wants us to install Shiny server?!? I want him to do it. I suggested a compromise:
			He sets us up a \texttt{shiny} user and we install our software under that.
\end{itemize}
\item[Fonts]
\begin{itemize}
\item Fonts were not discussed, unfortunately.
\end{itemize}
