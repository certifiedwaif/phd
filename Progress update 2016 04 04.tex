\begin{frame}{Progress last week}
\begin{itemize}
\def \O { \text{O} }
\item Theorem: $R^2_{\mX, \mZ} = R^2_\mX + \O(w_*)$
\item Final model decided
\item Numeric problems solved

\begin{frame}{IT Committee Meeting}
\begin{itemize}
\item The new computer budget increased to $\$2,700$.
\item You could buy a nice laptop for that. Or a great desktop machine. Paul will support any desktop
			machine from Dell.
\item Sarah, Chang and Kevin - you are all eligible. Get on it!!!
\item The issue of how often we should upgrade R was raised. Should we upgrade every year? Every six months?
			Every time that there's a new release?
\item Should we run the same version of R on the undergrad and research servers?
\item We need to discuss this as a group. What do you need?
\item Fonts were not discussed, unfortunately.
\end{itemize}

% \small
% \begin{itemize}
% \item In the meeting, Paul agreed to administrate the R Shiny Server if Jean buys the machine.
% \item I argued that it was not the job of PhD students or academic staff to administrate machines, but the job 
% 			of our systems administrators. We already have more than enough work to do.
% \item We don't have root/sudo access on School machines, and we don't want it either.
% \item Over the weekend, Paul completely back-flipped on this. He's now claiming that he never agreed to any
% 			such thing.
% \item I recall the discussion we had on this issue distinctly. The meeting minutes prove that he did agree.
% \item He now claims the department ``doesn't have the manpower''. I've successfully countered both claims. 
% 			Setting up a server	like this would take a competent systems admiinstrator a day, max. We've spent more 
% 			time discussing this than it would have taken!
% \item Over to you! I have research to do. I'm strongly considering stepping down from the committee.
