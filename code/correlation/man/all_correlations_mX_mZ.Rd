\title{Calculate the correlation of all the sub-models mX/mZ and vy, where mX is fixed in every model and the sub-models of mZ are included}
\usage{
all_correlations_mX_mZ(vy, mX, mZ, g_prior, intercept_col = 1L,
  bNatural_Order = FALSE, bIntercept = FALSE, bCentre = FALSE,
  cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{vy}{Vector of responses}

\item{mX}{Fixed covariate matrix}

\item{mZ}{Varying covariate matrix}

\item{g_prior}{The g-prior to use. The choices of g-prior available are "maruyama", "BIC", "ZE",
"liang_g1", "liang_g2", "liang_g3", "robust_bayarri1" and "robust_bayarri2"}

\item{intercept_col}{The index of the column in mX containing the intercept, if any}

\item{bNatural_Order}{Whether to return the results in natural order or graycode order. Defaults to graycode order.}

\item{bIntercept}{Logical value indicating whether there is an intercept column or not}

\item{bCentre}{Logical value indicating whether to centre the response vector and covariance matrix or not}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use}
}
\value{
A list containing 
vR2, the vector of correlations for each model
vp_gamma, the vector of number of covariates for each model
vlogp, the vector of logs of the likelihoods of each model
vinclusion_prob, the vector of inclusion probabilities for each of the covariates
}
\description{
Calculate the correlation of all the sub-models mX/mZ and vy, where mX is fixed in every model and the sub-models of mZ are included
