\title{Run a Collapsed Variational Approximation to find the K best linear models}
\usage{
cva(gamma_initial, vy_in, mX_in, K, lambda = 1, log_lik = "maruyama",
  bUnique = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gamma_initial}{Matrix of initial models, a K by p logical matrix}

\item{K}{The number of particles in the population}

\item{lambda}{The weighting factor for the entropy in f_lambda. Defaults to 1.}

\item{log_lik}{The log likelihood function to use in ranking models. One of
"log_prob1" "BIC" "ZE" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7".}

\item{bUnique}{Whether to ensure uniqueness in the population of particles or not. Defaults to true.}

\item{vy}{Vector of responses}

\item{mX}{Matrix of covariates}
}
\value{
A list containing the named element models, which is a K by p matrix of the models
				selected by the algorithm, and the named element trajectory, which includes a list
				of the populations of models for each iteration of the algorithm until it converged
