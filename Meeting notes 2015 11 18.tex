\section{Not enough references}
\begin{itemize}
\item One more paragraph for introduction - how this fits into Gaussian Variational Approximations, estimating the covariance of the q() distribution. Model: Our contributions are \ldots. Use Chong's paper as a model.
\item Paragraph often describes why it's important. Believe increased accuracy, by Ormerod and Wand and article
\item submitted today.
\item Latent Variable Models - unpublished paper
\item non-standard complications
\item Cite Cathy's work
\end{itemize}
