\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item Characterise numerical errors
\item Trade-off stability, accuracy and speed
\item Repeat speed experiments and average
\item We should have a maximum of ten figures and tables
\item Legends for accuracy figures. Numbers as percentages, only two decimal places of significant figures.
\item Combine accuracy figures into one.
\item Numerical integration on variance components.
\item Median accuracy, different colours, different methods: side by side.
\item Write paper.
\item $C=[Z, X]$
\item $C^T C = $ banded Chevron form
\item Further gains could be obtained using sparse matrix techniques, but ...
\item Increase font size, axis labelled, captions for all figures
\end{itemize}
