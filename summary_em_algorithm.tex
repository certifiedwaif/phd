\subsection{Fitting latent variable models with the EM algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete data likelihood is made up of observed variable and latent variable parts
\item The algorithm works by sub-dividing the complex optimisation of the complete data
likelihood into easier E and M steps where the observed variable likelihood parameters 
and latent variable likelihood parameters are repeatedly optimised relative to each 
other
\item The algorithm is guaranteed to increase or at least keep constant the log-
likelihood with each iteration
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Let's put some detail in here today. Then break this document up into sub-documents,
% and form a plan of attack for how to proceed.

This summary glosses over all of the important technical details, which I will now
proceed to attempt to fill in.
