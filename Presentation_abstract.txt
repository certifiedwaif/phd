Abstract: Zero inflated count data arises in many areas of application, such as
physical activity data, number of hospital visits per person per year and
number of insurance claims per year.

Standard models such as the Poisson do not work well for such data, so we turn
to zero-inflated models. But these models can be challenging to fit using
standard techniques, particularly if complications arise such such as repeated
observations or measurement error. We investigate fitting these models using
Variational Bayes approximations.
