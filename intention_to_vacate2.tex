\opening{Dear Frank,}

I am currently the lease holder of Unit 4, 28 Myra Road, Dulwich Hill.  I am
writing to inform you that I wish to terminate my lease as I have  found
another apartment to rent. I will vacate the premises 21 days after the date
of this letter. Please contact me to arrange a termination inspection.

\closing{Yours,}

\end{letter}
