\maketitle

Second paper is very equation heavy
First paper seems better in this regard
Compare old thresholdless version with new threshold version

\section{Third project}
\[
	q(g) = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \I(\gamma = \gamma_k)
\]

$\vgamma_1, \ldots, \vgamma_k$ are atoms or particles

$\log p(\vy) \geq \log \underline{p}(y; q) = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \log p(\vy, \vgamma_k) - w_k \log w_k$

where the last term is the entropy term, repels particles which are close together. So this balances goodness
of fit against a diverse range of solutions.
Constructed under the assumption that each of the gammas is unique
\[
	w_k = \frac{p(\vy, \vgamma_k)}{\sum_j p(\vy, \vgamma_j)}
\]
where
\[
	\vgamma_{jk} = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if } p(\vy, \vgamma_k^{(j, 1)}) > p(\vy, \vgamma_k^{(j, 0)})
		0 \text{ otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\]
Example $K = p$, $\vgamma_k = e_k$ covariate selection

Particle EM for Variable Selection
$R^2$, $n$, $p$ can be used to calculate Liang, AIC, BIC, Murayama and George

\[
	p(\vgamma_j | \theta) = \text{Bernoulli}(\theta), \rho \sim \text{Beta}(1, \rho)
\]
