\maketitle

John talked to me about writing an introduction. He generally starts in point form, and expands each point
to a paragraph. The flow usually goes from a broad outline of the field, to the specific problem that we're
interested in, then what others have done and finally our specific approach to the problem at hand.

John said I was reading papers in too much detail, and it was taking too much time. He recommended that I read
the abstracts only for most papers. He suggested that for my literature review on model selection, I look
at the references for Liang et al. 2007 and Murayama and George.

John suggested I write a section on implementation details e.g. Graycode in C, speed and performance issues.

He critiqued my second draft paper in various respects.

Brief descriptions about data sets, more verbose.

Graphs - it's hard to distinguish the lines which are the same colour
captions below, longer captions

Comparison of precision -- it is unclear what is being compared

p(g | y), x axis overwriting each other

Put the paper in ANZJS format
