\section{Testing}

John admonished me on my haphazard black box approach to testing, and pointed out that testing whether
the $R^2$ values were in range was ``worthless''. He suggested a much more systematic approach, whereby we
would ensure that each and every $R^2$ value was exactly right.

[\mX, \vy]
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{cor}($\vy, \mX \hat{\vbeta}_{LS})^2 = R^2$) \text{ using \texttt{lm}} 
\item $\frac{\vy^T \mX (\mX^T \mX)^{-1} \mX^T \vy}{\vy^T \vy}$
\item Same as 1 with $\mX' \leftarrow [\mX, \vx]$
\item Same as 2 with $\mX' \leftarrow [\mX, \vx]$
\item Update formula
\item Same as 1 with column renaming
\end{enumerate}
\section{Refactoring}

He also suggested that we refactor the rank one update and downdate code into seperate functions.
