\maketitle

Our choice of $a$ and $b$ is different from Maruyama and George, because they don't handle the "no intercept"
case. Our choice of $a$ and $b$ gives us closed form expressions.

"Prior is scale invariant" should be changed to "Marginal is scale-invariant"

Hyper prior on g, a mixture of g priors, avoid Bartlett's paradox and information paradox

prior on $\sigma^2$ is improper, Berger justifies that the posterior is proper

Empirical Bayes, maximise marginal likelihood with respect to $g$
	Local Empirical Bayes, each model
	Global, marginal distribution given $g$. George and Foster

Zellner-Siow prior on $g$, leads to model selection consistency

Look at Liang 2007 Theorem 3

hyper-g on n prior, Liang 2007

Computationally, use prior on $\vbeta$ to avoid dealing with the log of the determinant of
$(\mX^\top \mX)^{-1}$

Section 3.

Covariates scale free due to transformation on the covariate matrix $\mX$

Sentence on why $p(\vy)$ depending on gamma functions rather than something nastier like confluent
hypergeometric functions is important. Gamma functions are easier to deal with computationally

Result 1: The expectation and variance of $\vbeta$
Proof:

Check Maruyama and George for $R^2 \to 1$ implies $g/(1 + g) \to 1$

Result 2: $p(\sigma^2 | \vy)$

Talk more about Variational Bayes: more than 1 reference. Look at Chong's paper.

As sample size increases empirical Bayes estimators resemble fully Bayes estimators

If we change model slightly, full Bayes becomes computationally difficult whereas VB remains computationally
tractable

Transfer algebra from the formula sheets to appendix

George and Foster 2000 empirical Bayes estimates

Look at Lee and Clyde model selection in GLMs for desirable properties

Choice of $b$ makes $g$ $\BigO(n)$

Try $t=50$, see if things break

Try larger intercepts, see if you get problems

Look at what Nott and Linda did with a safer alternative to the exponential
