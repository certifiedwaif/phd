\maketitle

John and I talked about his new work on the cake prior.

John asked me to write a section on Exact Bayesian Inference.
Tables of Covariates in the thesis, not the paper.
For the covariate inclusion probabilities and model ranking plots, re-format them to be 4 columns and
3 columns respectively.
Scale figures to roughly half a page.
Hardcode range of y to be roughly -1 to 2, rather than -2 to 2 as it is now.
Each line in the figure needs to be distinguishable in black and white.
A \& NZ JoS usually accepts papers of 20 pages or so in length, so our draft will probably have to be 
shortened. Probably by dropping some of the unnecessary figures from the paper.
Try to eliminate whitespace from the text.
Define $\kappa$ closer to Numerical Experiments section. Include the values of $\kappa$ that we are using.

John asked me to re-format the paper slightly
1. Introduction
2. Model and Priors
3. Exact Bayesian Inference
4. Variational Inference
5. Numerical comparisons -- Implementation issues
6. Discussion  and Conclusion
