Meeting with Dr John Ormerod- 22/06/2015

Attendees: Dr John Ormerod, Mark Greenaway

Like me, he's nervous about the apparent contradiction between the good accuracy
plots.
- Meeting with John
  Intercept 2
  Slope 1
  rho 0.5
  Variance components .5^2
  Increasing variance components e.g. variance components 3.0 would ruin everything
  Example where accuracy low (i.e. reproducible example, find out why)
  Give data to John for median accuracy
  Things to check:
  * Accuracy poor for all or some
  * GVA NR, is max. iteration limit reached
  * Label plots with accuracy, multiple simulations
  * Same data being supplied to MCMC and VB?
  * Terminating early/premature convergence?
