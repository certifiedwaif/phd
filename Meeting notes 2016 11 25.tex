\section{Thesis structure}
Write at an Honours level audience

Chapter 0 - Introduction
Various kinds of variational approximations
Bayesian inference
Approximate inference
Splines
Components of model selection
Specific data sets, if any
Outline of thesis

Chapter 1 - Gaussian Variational Approximations
Cut and paste of paper

Chapter 2 - Normal linear model selection
Cut and paste of paper

Chapter 3 - 
Cut and paste of paper

Every piece of statistical writing approximately follows the structure
Introduction
Model
Methods
Theory, if any
Numerical section
Conclusion

\section{Zero-inflated models paper/chapter}
Need an example for thesis
There are two parameterisations, make the reader aware that we know about them.
Make figures and captions larger
Write a section on the computational cost of both approaches that we are using for the Gaussian Variational
Approximation
Plot of starting points from which the GVA algorithm successfully converge to the true answer

\section{New parameterisation}
$\lambda = f(\eta)$
where $\eta = \mX \vbeta + \mZ \vu$

Idea: Make link function exponential up to a threshold, and then quadratic from there

a x^2 + b x + c

Make quadratic match 0th, first and second derivatives of exponential function at threshold/transition point.

\frac{\lambda^x \e^{-\lambda x}}{x!}

x \log(\lambda) - \lambda x
