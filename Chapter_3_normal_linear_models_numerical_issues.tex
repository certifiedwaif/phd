$\tau_g$

Trapezoidal integration for $\E[g | \vy]$, choose points for function evaluation, how many and where. Use
John's Z_g_trapint code, which does clever things to find the endpoints of integration.

Accuracy of g. 10,000 grid points between 0 and 10. Functions exponentially decrease to 0 monotonically
outside of this interval.

Accuracy of $\sigma^2$, identities for $_1 F_2$ allow us to avoid overflows and numerically evaluate the
accuracy integral. 1,000 grid points spread between 0 and 10. Functions exponentially decrease to 0
monotonically outside of this interval.

Precision, identities for $_2 F_1$ allow us to avoid underflow and numerically evaluate the expression.

We work on the log scale to avoid one part of an expression overflowing and another part underflowing. Working
on the log scale leads to working with numbers which are smaller in magnitude, which avoids floating point
overflow and underflow. The large positive and negative logs of the terms in the expressions then have the
opportunity to additively cancel, and we can then exponentiate the resulting value to complete the
calculation. The price that we pay is the loss of accuracy from taking logs of the terms and then
exponentiating.
