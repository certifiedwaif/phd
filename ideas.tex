\section{Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the fact that if a prior is conjugate then a mixture of priors will be a mixture of conjugates to build
a mixture model
\item Dirichlet prior on weights
\item Find lower bounds by working with $\log p(y)$, terms not involving $q_i$ for current i simply get subtracted out so
we only optimise $q_i$ by taking expectations over all $q_j$ for $j \ne i$
\item $\text{MVN}(0, \sigma^2)$ for $\beta$ even if we're using basis splines?
\item Start coding in C if it's not too arduous - SDL for visualisation, GSL for maths. Integrates easily with R/Rcpp.
Develop in Eclipse or something standard.
\item Learn about flexible skew normals.
\end{itemize}
