\begin{frame}{Calculating confidence intervals for splines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Confidence intervals are calculated by grid search, calculating the
appropriate $mC_x$ for each value of $x$ with an appropriate set of knots
\item We then sample from the appropriate distribution 1000 times and take upper
and lower quintiles.
\item I was generating samples $\vnu \sim N(\vmu, \mLambda)$ and then 
calculating $\hat{f} = \mC_x \vnu$
% First image
\item I should have been generating samples $\hat{f} \sim N(\mC_x \vmu, \mC \mLambda \mC_x^\top)$
% Second image
\item That's better, but the confidence intervals are still the same size.
I'm not sure why this is yet. The MCMC might not be sampling effectively
\end{itemize}
