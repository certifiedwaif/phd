\frametitle{Tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item I did computer science first
\item Then I got bored and switched to maths/statistics
\item Now I'm somewhere in the intersection
\item Computer scientists and statisticians generally care about different things
\item It's been interesting seeing these worlds converge
\item I've tried to focus on things that are generally useful, and keep the techno-babble to a
			minimum
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{It's an R world \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item There's been an explosion of interest in data science in the last few years, which has 
			lead to a lot of people from the tech. industry coming into the community
\item The data science world has basically settled on two main languages: R and Python
\item R is also an important programming language in Bioinformatics
\item De facto standard in statistical research
\item Most statisticians would rather not learn another language
\item The good news is you don't have to: R is recognised as a first-class citizen in the data
			science world, and everything is expected to integrate with it
\item R's approach has been so successful that other languages have begun to copy it e.g. 					data frames, which is a clear signal that we're doing something right
\item Other languages are a \emph{long} way behind us
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Version control}
\begin{itemize}
\item "Dropbox for code"
\item Several popular version control systems: Git/GitHub, Subversion, Mercurial
\item GitHub most popular in the wider tech. community
\item Keep track of changes
\item Collaborate with others
\item Option of keeping repositories private if you don't want your code to be public yet
\item All popular R environments and text editors integrate with version control, so using it
			is not too much harder than saving files once it's set up
\item Many packages are now released on GitHub first, before being released on CRAN
\item Example: https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2
\end{itemize}

% \frametitle{Text editors/Integrated Development Environments}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Most of us use RStudio
% \item Lots of other options depending on your needs: Emacs, Vim, Sublime
% \item All have syntax highlighting, ability to run R commands, navigate R functions, code
% 			folding etc.

\frametitle{Hadley Wickham/RStudio's contributions \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item ggplot2 - Grammar of Graphics, now in maintenance mode
\item ggvis - Interactive Grammar of Graphics for R - the next version of ggplot2!
\item readr - Read flat files (CSV, TSV, FWF) into R up to 10x faster than base
\item tidyr - Data cleaning with spread and gather functions
\item dplyr - select/filter/mutate/summarise/arrange/group by; plyr for data frames
\item magrittr - ``Ceci n'est pas un pipe'' Piping. Ideas from functional programming.
			This library is becoming extremely popular.
\item stringr - String handling
\item lubridate - Date and time
\item testthat - Regression testing framework
\item Advanced R - the first few chapters are useful. The later chapters are perhaps a little
			esoteric for most people
\item R Packages - Learn to create R packages quickly
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Visualisation/Web applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item A lot of visualisation libraries are available in Javascript
\item htmlwidgets - Integrates R with Javascript. The following packages are already
			available:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Leaflet - Geo-spatial mapping
			\item dygraphs - Time series charting
			\item MetricsGraphics - Scatterplots and line charts with D3
			\item networkD3 - Graph data visualisation with D3
			\item d3heatmap - Interactive heatmaps with D3
			\item DataTables - Tabular data display
			\item threejs - 3D scatterplots and globes
			\item DiagrammeR - Diagrams and flowcharts
			\end{itemize}
\item shiny - Build a web application in R in five minutes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Spark}
\begin{itemize}
\item Successor to Hadoop
\item R support integrated into the main release: SparkR
\item Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
\item MLlib - distributed machine learning framework
	\begin{itemize}
  \item summary statistics, correlations, stratified sampling, hypothesis testing, random data generation
  \item classification and regression: SVMs, logistic regression, linear regression, decision trees, naive Bayes
  \item collaborative filtering: alternating least squares (ALS)
  \item clustering: k-means, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
  \item dimensionality reduction: singular value decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA)
  \item feature extraction and transformation
  \item optimization primitives: stochastic gradient descent, limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{The cloud \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item The cloud is someone else's computer
\item Cloud providers in Sydney: Amazon Web Services, Anchor, Rackspace etc.
\item Choice of Windows, Linux or whatever you like. If you choose Windows, Microsoft's 
			licencing fees will be included in your monthly bill
\item Bioconductor is available as an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
\item You can rent a machine as powerful as verona on demand for ~$\$2.31$ an hour, if you 
			just need the CPUs
\item It'll cost you $\$6.96$ if you want 244 gig. of RAM and 24 2 gig. hard disks as well
\item Assuming verona cost ~$\$30,000$, that's enough to rent the machine above for ~6 months
\item It still makes sense to buy machines. But it's also nice to be able to rent them for
			short periods.
\item It's good to have options.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Keeping up with all this stuff \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item The pace of change in this area is \emph{relentless}.
\item Twitter - Hadley Wickham and many other prominent R developers are on Twitter. If you 
			have a problem with something you can often ask them directly
\item Blogs - http://www.r-bloggers.com/ is a good starting point. Manage with an RSS reader 				like Feedly
\item If you're spending too much time on social media, you could try Leechblock.
			Works for me
\end{itemize}
