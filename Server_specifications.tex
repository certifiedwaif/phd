\section{Budget}
\$15k to \$25k. I think we can get what we need for well under this, probably less than \$10k.

\section{What to buy?}
Initially I was thinking we should get a new server. But after exploring the options, I
realised that our current server is fine. We aren't running out of CPU or memory. And if we
run out of those resources, we can get them later.

We just need more disks and faster I/O. I think we should buy Directly Attached Storage, and 
connect it to our server with a fast SAS (SCSI Across Serial) adapter.

\subsection{Hard disks}
At least $12 \times 3$ terabyte hard disks, for a total of 36 terabytes of storage.
There is a trade-off between rotational speed and storage capacity. From my
research, I think the best current trade-off for us is 10,000 RPM hard disks.

We can probably talk to the supplier about which mix of disks gives us the best 
performance/price ratio. But we should be getting at least this much storage.

\subsection{RAID}
We should buy DAS which supports RAID and allows us to configure it flexibly. We should use
RAID-0 (striping data across all disks). A single hard disk doesn't have a very high transfer
rate relative to the amounts of data that we have to process, but using RAID-0 or something
similiar we can be using all of our hard disks in parallel. This will speed things up 
considerably.

\subsection{SAS adapter}
We will connect the DAS to our existing server using a SAS adapter. As this is a potential
bottleneck, we should get the fastest one that we can find.
