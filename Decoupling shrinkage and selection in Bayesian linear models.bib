abstract = {Selecting a subset of variables for linear models remains an active area of research. This paper reviews many of the recent contributions to the Bayesian model selection and shrink- age prior literature. A posterior variable selection summary is proposed, which distills a full posterior distribution over regression coefficients into a sequence of sparse linear predictors.},
