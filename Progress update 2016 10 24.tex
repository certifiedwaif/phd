\begin{frame}{Numeric experiments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I had some numeric errors in my code, which was messing up my results when $p$ became large.
		\item I fixed an underflow so now we're getting nice continuous smooth curves for large values of
		      $p$ e.g. $500$ or more.
		\item The plot on the next slide shows the shrinkage from the fitted co-efficients to the
		      prior co-efficients as a function of $n$, $p$ and $R^2$. $1$ means no shrinkage, $0$ means complete
		      shrinkage.
		\item As $p$ gets larger, our approximation begins to match the exact calculation very closely.
		\item That's good!!!

\begin{frame}{Tidyverse, and packaging}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I was enviously looking at Kevin's data manipulation code which used \texttt{dplyr}. I thought
		      ``If you can't beat them, join them.'', so now I'm using it too.
		\item Hadley Wickham's packages all work well together. He's packaged them together as \texttt{tidyverse} so
		      that you can install and use them all easily:
		      \begin{verbatim}
						install.packages("tidyverse") \\
						library(tidyverse)
		\end{verbatim}
		\item All of the plots in my paper are made with \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{ggplot2} now. It wasn't \emph{that}
		      hard to switch from \texttt{base}.
		\item John said we should be ready to release our code. I do everything in packages now, so this
		      will be relatively easy. The code is packaged as \texttt{taug}.
		\item I'm using RStudio for package builds, because I'm using \texttt{Roxygen} and \texttt{Rcpp}. So far, I've
		      found building non-trivial packages without RStudio to be tricky.

\begin{frame}{Literature review}
	I've been reading lots of papers and writing summaries, so that I have a more solid idea of the field, and
	more to write in the introductory chapter of my thesis.

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{What's next?}
	    
	\begin{itemize}
		\item John wants us to compare this form of model selection to other forms of model selection criteria e.g.
		      AIC, BIC, DIC etc. So that requires more numeric experiments.
		\item We're mostly interested in the probability that a particular covariate gets selected by each different method.
		\item More writing. We want to submit this paper to a journal like the Australian and New Zealand Journal of
		      Statistics, so I'll look at their template this week.
		\item Think about the next project. John wants to do a project based on my correlation-calculating code. The
		      code's already written, so we hope this will go quickly.
