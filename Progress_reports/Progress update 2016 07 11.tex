\begin{frame}{Mean field updates}
\begin{itemize}
\item I believe the mean field updates are completed and correct.
\item I've checked them against John's working and they match.

\begin{align*}
\E\left[\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\right] &= \frac{n}{\left(1 - \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g}\right]\right) n R^2} \\
\beta_{q(g)} &= \left(\frac{n \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g}\right]}{[1 - \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g}\right]]} + p \right) \\
\vmu_{q(\vbeta)} &= \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g}\right] (\mX^\top \mX)^{-1} \mX^\top \vy \\
\mSigma_{q(\vbeta)} &= \E\left[\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\right] \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g}\right](\mX^\top \mX)^{-1} \\
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Much like the posterior means, as one would hope}
\begin{itemize}
\item They look a lot like the posterior means from Michael Jordan's lecture notes on Bayesian
statistics.
\item \begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\item So that's exciting, and a nice correspondence.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coding for mean field updates -- the easy part}
\begin{itemize}
\item I've translated John's R code to C++ 11.
\item Because John's code is nice and clean, well--commented 
and broken into functions in a sensible way, this was quite straightforward.
\item It compiles, but it's not tested. I think it's going to perform fine.
\item To get good performance, write good code with sensible algorithms, give it to the compiler and then
get out of the way.
\item The object file for the new code is only 44k. That bodes well -- fits in L1 cache.
\item And it'll vectorise.
\item So I'm not going to put any effort into optimising this at all. No need.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coding for mean field updates -- the hard part}
\begin{itemize}
\item Numerical software that produces the wrong answer is worthless, so I'm going to devote some of this week
to testing.
\item We test our software stringently, so I'm not expecting that to be
as straight--forward or easy.
\item John and I will discuss a test--plan, and then I'll run through it and find 
out what breaks.
\item Because something \emph{always} breaks.
\item I had to implement Whittaker's W function using the Wikipedia definition and the GNU Scientific
Library. I don't know anything about that. Bet you it doesn't work first go.
\item Apart from that more papers to read, more writing to do, and an abstract to prepare for ASC.
\end{itemize}
