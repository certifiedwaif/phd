\begin{frame}{Writing}
\begin{itemize}
\item I've learned a lot about writing in the past few months. I still have a lot left to learn
\item Draft of second paper on normal linear model selection is with John for final editing
\item Now back to my first paper on zero-inflated models
\item Writing preliminary material for my thesis
\item ''There's light at the end of the tunnel'' -- John
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{safeexp}
\begin{itemize}
\item I had a lot of overflow problems the last time I worked on zero-inflated Poisson models, because of the
			$\exp(x)$ function
\item John had the idea of defining a piecewise function which behaved like $\exp(x)$ up to a threshold $t$,
			and then like	a quadratic function beyond that threshold. So
			$$f(x) = 
			\begin{cases}
			e^{x}, x < t \\
			a x^2 + b x + c, x \geq t
			\end{cases}
			$$
			where $a$, $b$ and $c$ were chosen so that the function, first and second derivatives match at the
			point $t$.
\item I found the co-efficients $a$, $b$ and $c$ and implemented this, and so far it's working pretty well
\item More testing is needed, but this is promising
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{R 3.4.0 is coming soon}
Lots of performance improvements
\begin{itemize}
\item A just-in-time compiler will be included
\begin{quote}
In 3.4.0, loops in your R scripts and functions you write will be byte-compiled as you use them ("just-in-time"), 
so you can get improved performance for your R code without taking any additional actions.
\end{quote}
\item Linear algebra performance improvements
\item Accumulating vectors in a loop is faster
\item Improvements for packages with compiled code
\end{itemize}
It's good that the community is interested in working on these issues. That makes me feel things are headed in
the right direction. Every little bit helps
