\begin{frame}{Numeric results}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I had some numeric errors caused by underflow, which I fixed. So now I'm getting nice smooth curves.
		      \begin{figure}
		      	\includegraphics[scale=.25]{Chapter_3_shrinkage.pdf}
		      \end{figure}
		\item That's one major step closer to finishing the paper.
	\end{itemize}% Include nice graphs here
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tidyverse, and packaging}
\begin{itemize}
\item I saw Kevin using \texttt{dplyr} and friends, which I've been resisting for a while, and I thought
``If you can't beat them, join them''
\item Hadley Wickham grouped all his packages together into \texttt{tidyverse}, so now I just use that
\item I used \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{ggplot2} to generate the plots in my paper
\item It was fun, and not too hard
\item John said we should be ready to release our code when we finish the paper. I've gotten into the
habit of doing everything in packages, which makes releasing code a lot easier
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature review}
	I've been reading lots of papers, and I'm writing up summaries in my literature review. I hope this will
	make up part of the first chapter in my thesis.
