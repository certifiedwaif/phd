\begin{frame}{What I've been up to last week}
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculating confidence intervals for splines.
\item Reading Classical and Modern Numerical Analysis: Theory, Methods and Practice by Azmy S. Ackleh,
			Edward James Allen, R. Baker Kearfott, Padmanabhan Seshaiyer.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical and Modern Numerical Analysis and BFGS}
\begin{itemize}
\item This book achieves an amazing level of conciseness and clarity relative to other books on numerical
			methods that I've read. There are some nice proofs.
\item Numerical Optimisation by Nocedal and Wright is better for more depth.
\item BFGS approximates the inverse of the Hessian in Newton-Raphson with rank one updates based on
			the change in	gradient between iterations.
\item L-BFGS is an extension of this idea, which stores the last few gradient vectors and approximates the
			inverse Hessian from that.
\item In both algorithms, we avoid having to invert a p by p matrix, which saves us $O(p^3)$ floating
			point operations.
\item This rank one update idea seems very powerful.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Calculating confidence intervals for splines}
\begin{itemize}
\item We're examining the difference between the VB and MCMC fits. We expect the MCMC fit to have
more variance.
\item The spline model is $\hat{f}_x = \mC_x \vnu$, $\vnu \sim \text{N}(\vmu, \mLambda)$.
\item In this case, we model the function $f(x) = 4 \sin(\pi x)$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. As I'm
			working with Poisson models, I then exponentiate.
\item We calculate the appropriate $\mC_x$ for each value of $x$ within the range of the function.
\item We then sample from $\mC_x \vnu$ where the distribution of $\vnu$ is taken from the MCMC and VB
			model fits, and take the 95\% CI at each point $x$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Distribution that I was sampling from}
\begin{itemize}
\item I was generating samples $\vnu \sim \text{N}(\vmu, \mLambda)$ and then 
calculating $\hat{f}_x = \mC_x \vnu$.

\begin{frame}{Distributions I should have been sampling from}
\begin{itemize}
\item I should have been generating samples from $\hat{f}_x \sim \text{N}(\mC_x \vmu, \mC_x \mLambda \mC_x^\top)$.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why are the confidence intervals such similiar widths?}
\begin{itemize}
\item That's better, but the MCMC fit doesn't seem to be noticeably wider.
\item Perhaps the MCMC isn't sampling very effectively?
\item Maybe something else is wrong.
\item Requires further investigation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
