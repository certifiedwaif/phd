\begin{frame}{Reading and writing}
\begin{itemize}
\item My abstract for a fifteen minute talk on Gaussian Variational Approximations at ASC 2016 was accepted
\item John asked me to write a page a day. So I'm trying to do that. I find this focuses me
\item A lot of my time is spent writing, reading or looking for references for things
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Posterior covariance of $\vbeta$}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The exact posterior covariance of $\vbeta$ turns out to be
\tiny
\begin{align*}
	\Cov(\vbeta|\vy) &=  \Var\left[\frac{g}{1+g} \Bigm| \vy\right] \vbetahatls \vbetahatls^\top + 
	 \E\left[\frac{g}{1 + g} \left( 1 - \frac{g}{1 + g} R^2 \right) \Bigm| \vy\right] (\mX^\top \mX)^{-1}\\
	&= (G_2 - G_1^2) \vbetahatls \vbetahatls^\top + \left( \frac{n}{n - 2} \right) (G_1 - G_2 R^2) (\mX^\top \mX)^{-1}
\end{align*}
\small where \tiny
\begin{align*}
G_1 &= \frac{\Beta(p/2 + a + 1, b + 2)}{\Beta(p /2 + a + 1, b + 1)} (1 - R^2)^{b+1} {}_2 F_1(n/2, b + 1; n/2 + 1; R^2) \\
G_2 &= \frac{\Beta(p/2 + a + 1, b + 3)}{\Beta(p /2 + a + 1, b + 1)} (1 - R^2)^{b+1} {}_2 F_1(n/2, b + 3; n/2 + 2; R^2)
\end{align*}
\small
which are univariate functions of $n$, $p$ and $R^2$.
So we can compare the performance of the exact and approximate covariance by comparing these 
functions
\item I wrote the code for this on Saturday, and put it in the \texttt{taug} package. I'll get numerical 
results this week, and think of a nice way to present them
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{ICT Review/IT committee meeting/HPC}
\begin{itemize}
\item ICT review: looking to reduce duplication of effort. I'm still not sure what that means \ldots
\item IT Committee Meeting: Geoff Vasil and I asked for a queueing system, like we have on HPC
\item Paul said this wasn't the right solution, and instead
proposed a solution based on processor affinity
\item I'll provide my \texttt{correlation} code to them as an example, so they can advise us
\item My time is better spent on my own work
\item HPC: Outsourced to Dell, whose admins are apparently pretty helpful
\item Code repository: something like BitBucket or GitHub
\item Dr Geoffrey Vasil talked about working in the open?
\end{itemize}
