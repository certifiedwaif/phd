\part{Meeting with Jean, Shila and John}
Jean told me informally at the lab meeting that I'd been drafted into the bioinformatics team
to help solve computational issues.

\section{Data sets}
There are two sets of data that we're working with
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hodis, A Landscape of Driver Mutations in Melanoma
Methods not published. n=120. Downloaded their data. Matched samples: tumour and normal.
\item In-house data, Mann's group.
Matched samples: tumour and blood. n = 27.
\end{enumerate}

The samples are being run through MuTeCT. Each sample currently takes 12 hours to run.

\section{Research questions of interest}
What is driving changes? Regulation network? Is it mutation? Is this commonly seen in
multiple cancers?

Mutation analysis is a ``hot'' topic of research right now.

\section{What to read?}
GCSA, gene set analysis
Network, variability of correlation is disrupted between the two groups.
Mutation score. What does this mean?

Modified Hotelling's $T^2$ test.
Mut. Seq tells mutations of every single person.
We want the mutation data.
